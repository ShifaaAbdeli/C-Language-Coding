Write a function to delete the first node of a doubly-linked list and return the head of the modified list. Be sure to deallocate the memory of the node!

// stdio.h, string.h have been included for this problem.
// You don't need any other header files.

// Add any helper functions(if needed) above.
doublyListNode*  delete_at_head(doublyListNode* head){   
    
    doublyListNode *temp;
    
    if (head == NULL) {
        return (head);
    }
    temp = head;
    
    head = head->next;
    head->prev = NULL;
    free(temp);
    
    return(head);

}
