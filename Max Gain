Given an array of integers, write a method - max_gain - that returns the maximum gain. Maximum Gain is defined as the maximum difference between 2 elements in a list such that the larger element appears after the smaller element. If no gain is possible, return 0.

// stdio.h, string.h have been included for this problem.
// You don't need any other header files.

// Add any helper functions(if needed) above.
int max_gain(int arr[], int sz){
    
    int i;
    int minArr = arr[0];
    int max_gain = arr[1] - arr[0];
    
    for (i = 1; i < sz; i++) {
        if (arr[i] - minArr > max_gain) {
           max_gain = arr[i] - minArr;
        }
        
        if (arr[i] < minArr) {
            minArr = arr[i];
        }
    }
    if (max_gain < 0) {
        max_gain = 0;
    }
    return (max_gain);
}
