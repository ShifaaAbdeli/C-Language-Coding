Difficulty Level 1 Problem

A palindrome is a string or sequence of characters that reads the same backward as forward. For example, "MADAM" is a palindrome. Write a function that takes in an input string: char* str and returns an int value of 1 if the input string is a palindrome, 0 otherwise.
An empty string is considered a palindrome. You also need to account for the space character - i.e. "race car" should return 0 as read backward it is "rac ecar".

// stdio.h, string.h have been included for this problem.
// You don't need any other header files.

// Add any helper functions(if needed) above.
int is_string_palindrome(char* str) {
    int i;
    int len = strlen(str);
    
    for (i=0; i<= len/2; i++) {
        if (str[i] == str[len-1 -i]) {
            continue;
        } else {
            return 0;
        }
    }
    return 1;
}
